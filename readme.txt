--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
Adding favicon: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4888377/how-to-add-a-browser-tab-icon-favicon-for-a-website
Many of the resources and examples available at https://www.w3schools.com
-img slideshow/carousel: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
Daniel Qi, a fellow Computer Science major at UCI; not in the class, but has self taught himself the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
-We discussed how flexible, yet frustrating web dev is and he gave me some pointers as to how to look things up for help.

Al Prachumsri, same as above

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Using the development emulators on browsers causes a lot of visual arifacts that shouldn't otherwise be present, nor are present when just resizing the browser manually.
(i.e emulator causes the html to shrink in width despite being set to width:100%, fixed elements still scroll)
